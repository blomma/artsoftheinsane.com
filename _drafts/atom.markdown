Why [atom.io](http://atom.io)?

For a long time I followed along [TextMate 2 development](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) and being a enthusiastic user of TextMate 1 the transition seemed natural. And it's a fine editor, no doubt of it, but it didn't scratch my itch anymore. I felt unsure of the future of TextMate, which might be as likely a sign of me getting older than anything else.
But more than that, I wanted something I could easily hack and modify to my liking, and altho I could get started with packages in TextMate I longed for something more hackable.

So to vim I turned and as I am prone to do I started to set it up as I wanted it to look and feel, the result which you can see below.

and when that was done I started to use Vim. Jebus knows I tried, I truly did. The modal thing I could sort of handle, but it didn't feel natural, whatever that means, but at the end of the day Vim just didn't mesh with me.
