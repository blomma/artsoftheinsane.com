Guild Wars 2 is a odd duck, I've been trying to get into it for a long time, plodding along with my engineer but never finding it sticking to me. The personal story has always felt disconnected from me, both the character and me as a person playing the game.

A couple of days ago I dinged 80 and with that the last chapters of the personal story opened up. And this time in an effort of immersing myself I decided to go thru it all in quick succession in an attempt to make it less hacked up. On I went, and for the first time enjoying the story and understanding what was happening.

Until I hit the last part where the designers had decided that forcing me to team up was a solid decision. Going from a story where I had soloed it up to this point it felt incredibly frustrating to have to stop and endure the complete shitstorm that is grouping. Yes i said shitstorm, because if by a stroke of luck I manage to find a group during my limited window of gaming I still have to complete it with a group of strangers, all with different motivation on why they are there.
And I can guarantee you that not many of them are there to enjoy the story laid out, which for me was the whole point of running it.
