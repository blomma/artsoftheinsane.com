title:  Meantime to Urbanears Medis failure
---

128 days ago, or so, I returned my [Urbanears Medis](http://www.urbanears.com/headphones/medis) headphones, for the fourth time they developed a glitch which drops the sound in a random ear and for the fourth time I had the pleasure of dealing with their customer support.

Curious as I am it got me wondering when I could expect my current number 5 to break down. So I dug into my gmail folder to unearth the dozen or so messages that had been flying back and forth between their customer support and me to construct a timeline of sorts.

As we can see, the time my buds stay in service is increasing, but not because of better build quality, no sire bob. It has more to do with the fact that I am being super careful these days on how I use them, how I fold them and how I carry them to the point of being anal.

I bought them for 500 SEK and at this point I'm only in this to see how many times they will exchange them for me. With a bit of luck (depending on how you see this) these might be the last headphones I will ever have to buy.
