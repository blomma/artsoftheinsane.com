Added two views, one for showing the timer and tags and the second one for showing a… i guess showing a list of dates and times, a bit unclear at the moment to be honest.

	08:31 - 08:45 @it-frulle 14 minutes

Also added swipe action to take you from screen #1 to screen #2 and back again, all without writing a single line of code

This is not what i want, i want a PageControl and different pages that i move thru in this case only two of them.

Okay, take two, I've created a View Controller, added a UIScrollView and Page Controll to it, now to create the rest of the pages
